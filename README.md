## Introduction

![demo_vid](assets/demo.gif)

Recent advances in visual localization and mapping integrate point and line features effectively but at high computational costs. We propose a lightweight neural network that jointly represents 3D points and lines, achieving state-of-the-art pose accuracy with minimal overhead. A single transformer block encodes line features as point-like descriptors, treated as distinct yet interconnected feature sets. Using self- and cross-attention within graph layers, our method refines features before regressing 3D maps via two simple MLPs. Experiments show superior indoor localization over Hloc and Limap and a significant lead in outdoor benchmarks, surpassing learning-based approaches.
